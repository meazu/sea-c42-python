Homework 7 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.3

Problem 3:

Prefixing with "#" character makes code as a comment and hence python ignore that part of the code.
The execution of the code by commenting "seq = 0" and "linenum = 0" raised following exception.

..........
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 38, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

  File "dna_analysis.py", line 43, in <module>
    seq = seq + line
NameError: name 'seq' is not defined
...........

Like other programming languages, python first calculates the value and then assign it to variable (right -> left). Internally, memory is not allocated for the variable linenum. But we are trying to access the value of linenum in the for loop. 

By commenting the code "gc_count = 0" raised the following exception.

..............
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 64, in <module>
    gc_count = gc_count + 1
NameError: name 'gc_count' is not defined
...............

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.3
AT-content: 0.7

Problem 5:

Number of G nucleotides: 1
Number of C nucleotides: 2
Number of A nucleotides: 5
Number of T nucleotides: 2


Problem 6:

test-small.fastq : gcat_count,total_count and length_sequence are same.
For all the below files 
sample_1.fastq
sample_2.fastq 
sample_3.fastq
sample_4.fastq
sample_5.fastq
sample_6.fastq
test-moderate-gc-1.fastq
test-moderate-gc-2.fastq
test-high-gc-1.fastq
test-high-gc-2.fastq:
total_count, length_sequence are same and gcat_count is diiferent because in these files apart from G, C, A, T Nucleotides there are other Nucleotides. gact_count is the count of the G, C, A, T Nucleotides where as total_count is the count of the all nucleotides in a sequence and length_sequence is the length of the sequence which is same as total_count.

GC content is not equal to(G+C)/(A+C+G+T)) because GC content is calculated as count of G and C nucleotides to the toal number of nucleotides which has other nucleotides apart from G, C, A, T.

I have corrected the program and calculated GC, AT content ratio as total number of theG and C nucleotides to the toal number of G, C, A, T.


Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 1.3223416174746196


Problem 8:

GC Classification: Moderate GC content

Collaboration:

No one did.

Reflection:

I have learned assignment, I/O, Iteration and conditional operations in python. Initially i felt difficult in understanding fileinput objects. It would have been better if I did a small assignment on it.
